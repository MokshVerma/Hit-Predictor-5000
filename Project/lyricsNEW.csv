believe natalie listen natalie last chance find gogo dance disco please believe natalie listen natalie last chance find gogo dance disco forget said soho leave ohnos believe natalie listen natalie last chance
know want im gonna take midnight show tonight keep secret got blanket back seat mind little place sits beneath sky turned face speak one heard cry drive faster boy drive faster boy know there hope there many people tryin help cope got real short skirt
dudududu believe im coming find take night run make right wont forget least ill try run run tonight everything alright everything alright everything alright everything alright everything alright
feel like night today somethin here right today uptight today paranoia got left dont know stressed first pressure fed know feel like voice back head like face hold inside face awakes close eye face watch every time lie face laugh every time fall know time sink swim face inside hearin right underneath skin like im paranoid lookin back like whirlwind inside head like cant stop im hearing within like face inside right beneath skin
cannot take anymore saying everything ive said word make sense find bliss ignorance le hear le youll say youll find anyway like everything say need little room breathe cause im one step closer edge im break find answer arent clear wish could find way disappear thought make sense find bliss ignorance nothing seems go away
woke dream today cold static put cold foot floor forgot yesterday remembering im pretending im anymore little taste hypocrisy im left wake mistake slow react even though youre close youre still distant cant bring back true way feel promised face sound voice painted memory even youre im see keeping everything inside see even close eye
forfeit game somebody else take frame put name shame cover face cant run race pace fast wont last love way look taking pleasure awful thing put take away give life pride broken like think youre never wrong act like youre someone want someone hurt like want share love thing say ill
crawling skin wound heal fear fall confusing real there something inside pull beneath surface consuming confusing lack selfcontrol fear neverending controlling cant seem find wall closing without sense confidence im convinced there much pressure take ive felt way insecure
graffiti decoration sky dust constant wave tension top broken trust lesson taught learned never true find question guilty association wanna run away never say goodbye wanna know truth instead wondering wanna know answer lie wanna shut door open mind paper bag angry voice sky dust another wave tension filled talk taking action word never true find question guilty association
ignore behind follow instinct blindly hide pride bad dream give sad thought maddening sit try stand try catch redhanded trust get fooled phoniness trust nobody live loneliness cant hold im stretched thin make right move im lost within put daily fa√ßade end getting hurt ask cant rely ask cant rely cant hold much take cant hold thought failure sinking
start one thing dont know doesnt even matter hard try keep mind designed rhyme explain due time know time valuable thing watch fly pendulum swing watch count end day clock tick life away unreal didnt look watch time go right window trying hold didnt even know wasted watch go kept everything inside even though tried fell apart meant eventually memory time
watch moon sits sky dark night shining light sun sun doesnt give light moon assuming moon gonna owe one make think act favor rapidly turn around start askin thing want back im sick tension sick hunger sick acting like owe find another place feed greed find place rest wanna another place hate say dont understand wanna energy enemy place head maybe day ill like step people like run away people thought knew remember back
top bottom bottom top stop core ive forgotten middle thought taken far safety picture memory wont escape care top bottom bottom top stop core ive forgotten middle thought taken far safety picture memory wont escape care there place dark cant see end sky cock back shock cant defend rain sends dripping acidic question forcefully power suggestion eye shut looking rust rot dust small spot light flood floor pours rusted world pretend eye ease open dark top bottom bottom top stop core ive forgotten middle thought taken far safety picture memory wont escape care
folk special guest tonight would like introduce mr hahn
ive lied way always last smile ill fake sake sacrifice hiding lie sacrifice never knowing never walked away played way see testing push away never walked away
december time year december clear december snow covered home december alone
know mean could put label life put label lifestyle sometimes know put label wake every morning go bed night hybrid ive diggin crate ever since livin space ratrace monkey human trait mastered numerology bigbang theology performed lobotomy telekinetic psychology invented mic could start blessin chincheckin kid make point like impressionist many men tried shake u twist mic cord double helix show im made buckle knee like leg brace cast spell instrumentalness emcee hate u try leave without shoulder cry infinity let icon bygone fire bomb ghostly note haunt tried threat moved promise stomp shit without accomplice run gauntlet whoever want high voltage unforgettable sound high voltage bringing taking high voltage coming every side high voltage making rhythm rhyme collide akira put kink backbone clone microphone never satisfy rhyme jones sprayin bright day might say
feel like night today something here right today uptight today paranoia got left dont know stressed first pressure fed know feel like voice back head like face hold inside face awakes close eye face watch every time lie face laugh every time fall know time sink swim face inside hearing right underneath skin like im paranoid lookin back like whirlwind inside head like cant stop im hearing within like face inside right beneath skin

farewell there blood there alibi cause ive drawn regret truth thousand lie let mercy come wash away ive done ill face cross ive become erase let go ive done put rest thought clean slate hand uncertainty
